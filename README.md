 Vue-element-user, hi!
 
 
 Bye, vue-element-user.


  Due to the rush of time and the change of plans, I have to use the vue-element-admin template for development. This website program design that I spent a lot of energy but haven't completed has to be stopped. This is the result of knocking the keyboard from scratch, including many experiences and my new ideas. I deeply appreciate it, Therefore, I have no choice but to upload it here for future review and share it with you, the another meaning to commemorate it, because when will I contact front-end development next time? Maybe it's building my own blog, maybe doing software development, or maybe it's far away.


  Among them, only about half of the development documents have been completed, if you are interested in it, you can see "开发文档.docx". and they have been uploaded in a hurry and have not been reviewed.


  When the local development runs the test, the program runs normally, but after 'npm run build' packages it, the web side cannot execute normally as desired. Therefore, there is no demo sample website for this project, and the packaged project can be seen in the "dist" directory.


  It is also normal that "index.html" cannot be accessed normally after it is opened locally, because the different sources protocol of file:// and http(s):// make it impossible to use Cookies.


  In addition, due to the "node_modules" folder contains a large number of files, so I compressed it into ZIP format. You can unzip it and run the Vue program in the root directory using the command line 'npm run serve'. By the way, software H-builder is really good for the development.


  Please allow me to think that doing front-end development is a very fun, interesting and fulfilling thing. When I am lonely, he can accompany me like a friend.


  Thank you.
